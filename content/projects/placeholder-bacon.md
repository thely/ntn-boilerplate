My senior thesis project was a five song EP and an exploration of marketing practices within the world of musical theatre. My younger brother is writing a musical. Together, we crafted this EP to introduce the world to this beautiful story. *Songs From My Elijah* is available on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and more.

> In early 1940s Germany, 15 year-old Elijah Metzinger runs away from home when the Nazis find out about his sexuality. He goes into hiding with 3 Jewish strangers: Danny Haussler, Rosalyn Freyda, and Frederick Lemaire. While in hiding, Elijah looks back on his childhood before everything went into chaos, gets to know his fellow fugitives, and develops a powerful relationship with Danny. Living in a broken world with a broken heart, will Elijah see the end of this dark horror that is The Holocaust?
